Tools for dual-career households to find housing and minimize commuting times

The python files included here are the framework to build an applicaion which can assist dual-career (or n-career) housholds in finding the most efficient and equitable locations for housing. The data collected for this application comes from the Google Maps API and based on the following inputs:

* Latitude/Longitude of starting locations
* Estimated Arrival/Departure times
* number of days traveled per work week
* Weighting of total commute time with equity of driving distance
* Map resolution

With time, additional inputs will be set up to fine tune the output for the user's preferences
